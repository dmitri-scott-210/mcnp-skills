EXAMPLE: Point Isotropic Neutron Source (D-T Fusion Generator)
SOURCE: example_sources/01_point_isotropic.i
COMPLEXITY: Basic

DEMONSTRATES:
- Simplest possible source definition
- Point source at origin (POS=0 0 0)
- Isotropic emission (default, 4π solid angle)
- Monoenergetic (ERG=14.1 MeV)
- Single particle type (PAR=N for neutrons)

KEY FEATURES:
- Source: D-T fusion reaction produces 14.1 MeV neutrons
- Geometry: 30 cm radius water sphere (simple detector)
- Tallies: F4 (flux) and F6 (heating) to measure deposition
- Material: Water with thermal scattering (MT card)

TYPICAL USE CASES:
- Neutron generator simulation
- Benchmark problem for code verification
- Teaching example for basic MCNP usage
- Starting point for more complex sources

PHYSICS:
- 14.1 MeV neutrons undergo elastic scattering in water
- Hydrogen has large elastic cross-section → efficient moderator
- Most neutrons thermalize before escaping 30 cm sphere
- F4 tally shows flux spectrum degradation with energy

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- k-eff: N/A (fixed source, not criticality)
- Peak flux: Near thermal energies (< 1 eV)
- Heating: ~14 MeV per source neutron absorbed in sphere
- Run time: < 1 minute for 100k histories

MODIFICATIONS:
- Change ERG=14.1 to other energies (e.g., 2.5 MeV for D-D fusion)
- Change POS to relocate source (e.g., POS=0 0 -10 for offset)
- Add DIR=D1 with SI1/SP1 for anisotropic emission
- Change PAR=P for photon source (e.g., Co-60)

RELATED EXAMPLES:
- 02_monodirectional_beam.i: Directional source (beam)
- 03_watt_fission_spectrum.i: Realistic energy spectrum

VALIDATION:
- Should produce smooth flux spectrum from 14.1 MeV to thermal
- Check that F6 heating is positive (neutrons depositing energy)
- Verify no lost particles (check summary table)
