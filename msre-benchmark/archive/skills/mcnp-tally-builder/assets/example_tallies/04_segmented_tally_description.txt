Example 4: Segmented Tally (FS/SD Cards)

PURPOSE:
Demonstrate spatial segmentation of a tally using FS card to divide a single cell into multiple tally bins without creating extra geometry.

GEOMETRY:
- Single water sphere (10 cm radius)
- Source at bottom (z = -8 cm) pointing upward
- Three segmenting planes divide sphere into 4 regions

TALLY DETAILS:
- F4:N = Flux tally in cell 1
- FS4 = Tally segment card divides cell 1 into spatial bins
- Format: FS4  ±s1 ±s2 ... ±sk [T]
  - Each surface creates a boundary
  - Sign (±) determines which side scores to that bin
  - T option adds total bin
- K surfaces create K+1 bins (+ total if T present)
- SD4 = Segment divisor specifying volumes for each bin

SEGMENTATION LOGIC:
With FS4 -10 11 12 T:
1. Bin 1: Negative side of surface 10 (z < -5 cm)
2. Bin 2: Positive side of surface 11, excluding Bin 1 (-5 < z < 0)
3. Bin 3: Positive side of surface 12, excluding Bins 1 & 2 (0 < z < 5)
4. Bin 4: Everything else not yet tallied (z > 5 cm)
5. Bin 5: Total across all segments (T option)

KEY LEARNING POINTS:
1. FS card divides cell WITHOUT creating additional cells
2. Segmenting surfaces don't need to be in cell definitions
3. Order and sense of surfaces on FS card matters
4. SD card must provide volume/area for each segment
5. Useful for axial/radial distributions in simple geometries

SD CARD REQUIREMENTS:
- Number of entries = number of FS bins (including total if T present)
- MCNP cannot auto-calculate segment volumes → SD required
- Each entry is volume (cm³) for corresponding segment
- Hierarchy: SD card > VOL card > MCNP calculation > FATAL ERROR

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Five tally bins showing spatial flux distribution
- Higher flux near source (bottom, Bin 1)
- Decreasing flux with distance from source
- Total bin = sum of segments 1-4

VARIATIONS TO TRY:
- Radial segmentation: Use concentric spheres (SO cards)
- Angular segmentation: Use planes through origin
- Multiple segmentations: FS4 using CZ (radial) + PZ (axial)
- Add material regions: Combine FS with different materials in each segment
- Remove T option to exclude total bin
