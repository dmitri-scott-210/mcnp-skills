Example 5: Pulse-Height Detector (F8 with Zero/Epsilon Bins)

PURPOSE:
Simulate pulse-height tally in a NaI detector to demonstrate F8 energy deposition with proper zero and epsilon bins.

GEOMETRY:
- Point gamma source (662 keV Cs-137)
- Cylindrical NaI detector (5 cm long × 5 cm diameter)
- Detector at 10 cm from source

TALLY DETAILS:
- F8:P = Pulse-height tally (energy deposited per history)
- E8 card with CRITICAL zero and epsilon bins:
  - E8 0 = Zero bin (histories with NO energy deposition)
  - E8 1E-5 = Epsilon bin (very small depositions from artifacts)
  - E8 0.1 ... 1.0 = Physical bins (actual pulse-height spectrum)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Zero and epsilon bins are MANDATORY for F8 tallies!
Without them, normalization is lost and statistics are meaningless.

KEY LEARNING POINTS:
1. F8 scores TOTAL energy deposited in cell per source particle
2. Zero bin captures non-interacting particles (essential for normalization)
3. Epsilon bin captures computational artifacts (delta rays, rounding)
4. Energy bins are PULSE energy (total deposited), NOT particle energy
5. F8 is fundamentally different from F4/F6 (per-history, not per-event)

F8 SPECIAL FEATURES:
- Cannot use DE/DF dose functions
- Cannot use FM multipliers
- Cannot use CF/SF flagging
- Variance reduction limited (no WWG, use WWN instead)
- Use VAR RR=off to disable roulette for realism

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Zero bin: Fraction of gammas that pass through without interaction
- Epsilon bin: Very small (near-zero) depositions
- Photopeak: Near 662 keV (full energy deposition)
- Compton continuum: Partial energy depositions (0-480 keV)
- Backscatter peak: ~200 keV (180° Compton scatter)

PULSE-HEIGHT PHYSICS:
- Photopeak: Complete energy absorption (photoelectric + Compton)
- Compton edge: Maximum Compton transfer (~480 keV at 662 keV)
- Backscatter: Gammas scattered 180° before entering detector
- X-ray escape: Iodine K-shell x-rays (28 keV) escape detector

VARIATIONS TO TRY:
- Different sources: Co-60 (1.17/1.33 MeV), Na-22 (511/1275 keV)
- Detector sizes: Vary cylinder dimensions
- Shielding: Add lead collimator around detector
- Multiple peaks: Use multiple source energies (SI/SP cards)
- Realistic detector: Use FT8 PHL with NaI-1 response
