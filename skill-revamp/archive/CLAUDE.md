# CLAUDE.md - DEPRECATED (Session 11)

**This file has been replaced by modular documents.**

---

## ⚠️ FOR SESSION STARTUP, READ THESE DOCUMENTS IN ORDER:

1. **CLAUDE-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md** - Mandatory startup procedure (7 steps)
2. **LESSONS-LEARNED.md** - 12 documented lessons from previous sessions

---

## Why This Change?

**Session 11 (2025-11-03):** User disabled autocompact feature and is manually managing session transitions. The original CLAUDE.md contained significant redundancy with CLAUDE-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md.

**Restructuring completed:**
- CLAUDE-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md → Single source of truth for all procedures
- LESSONS-LEARNED.md → Extracted institutional knowledge (12 lessons)
- CLAUDE.md → Deprecated (this file is now just a pointer)
