Thus, PSC is this constant everywhere in the cone and zero elsewhere.
Multiplying this PSC and biased starting weight gives or WGT × 0 . 5 ,
which is the expected result for an isotropic source.

Another source type that requires caution is a user-supplied source that
is energy-angle correlated. For example, assume a source has a Gaussian
distribution in energy where the mean of the Gaussian is correlated in
some manner with µ . In subroutine SRCDX , the µ 0 to a point detector
must be calculated and the energy of the starting particle must be
sampled from the Gaussian based on this µ 0 . This must be done for each
point detector in the problem, thus guaranteeing that the direct source
contribution to each detector will be from the proper energy spectrum.
The original energy of the starting particle as well as all the other
starting parameters selected in subroutine SOURCE are automatically
restored after the direct source contribution to detectors is made.
Thus, the subroutine SOURCE is still sampled correctly.

## 10.4.1 Table Data/Model Physics Mix and Match

Consider a neutron problem with deuterium and tritium. The available
deuterium library contains values valid up to 150 MeV, but the tritium
library goes up to only 20 MeV. Previously, either neutron physics
models above 20 MeV (neglecting the deuterium table data up to 150 MeV)
or nuclear data tables below 150 MeV (using the 20-MeV tritium data
throughout the 20-150-MeV range) had to be used. Using the mix-and-match
capability available through the tabl parameter of the PHYS : P card,
the user can specify that deuterium use tables up to 150 MeV and use
physics models above 150 MeV and that tritium use data tables up to 20
MeV and use physics models above 20 MeV.

Figure 10.47 shows an example of the energy-matching capability. The
100-MeV neutrons are incident on an 8.433-cm-long, 3.932-cm-radius BGO
crystal. The crystal contains 21% bismuth, 16% germanium, and 63%
oxygen. Assume no germanium libraries are available. The solid line
represents flux in the crystal with the full mix-and-match capability,
which uses all libraries up to their energy limits and physics models
above those limits and for germanium. The dashed-line calculation uses
the old method of substituting arsenic for the missing germanium
library, using the libraries up to 20 MeV and using physics models
above. The dotted line uses bismuth and oxygen libraries up to their
limits of 150 MeV; the arsenic library is used up to its limit of 20
MeV, and then the 20-MeV data are used from 20 to 150 MeV; above 150
MeV, physics models are used for all three nuclides. This last option is
least desirable but often was used in past code versions to take
advantage of the 150-MeV libraries, even though many data libraries go
only to 20 MeV.

## 10.5.1 Neutron Production from a Spallation Target

One of the fundamental quantities of interest in most spallation target
applications is the number of neutrons produced per beam particle
incident on target. For targets fed by proton accelerators, this
quantity is typically denoted as 'n/p'. Here, we demonstrate how one
goes about calculating this quantity for a simple target geometry using
MCNP6.

The geometry consists of a simple right circular cylinder of lead, 10 cm
in diameter by 30 cm long. A beam of 1-GeV protons is launched onto the
target. The beam has a 7-cm-diameter spot size, with a parabolic spatial
profile. See Fig. 10.48.

In MCNP6, net neutron production is tallied implicitly and is provided
by default in the problem summary for neutrons. The problem summary
shows net neutron production resulting from nuclear interactions (the
component that accounts for neutron production by all particles
transported using INC/Preequilibrium/Evaporation physics) and net
production by (n, x n) reactions (neutrons created in inelastic nuclear
interactions by neutrons below the transition energy, using evaluated
nuclear data). Net production from nuclear interactions is given by the
difference of the neutron weights in the 'neutron creation' and 'neutron
loss' columns. A similar approach is taken to calculate net (n, x n)
production. Net neutron production may also be calculated by realizing
that the only loss mechanisms for neutrons are escape and capture. The
sum of the weights in the 'neutron loss' column under 'escape' and
'capture' is thus equal to the net neutron production. The values listed
in the problem summary are 'collision estimators,' meaning they are
tallied when a collision occurs during transport. Uncertainties are not
calculated by MCNP6 for these collision-estimated quantities. A
reasonable upper limit on the relative uncertainty would be given by the
inverse square root of the number of source particles launched.

We provide here four different variations for the calculation of net
neutron production for this simple target geometry. In the 'base case'
we transport protons, neutrons, and charged pions. The transition energy
between LAHET physics and neutron transport using tabular nuclear data
is set to the default ( tabl = -1 ), which means that 'mix and match'
(see §5.6.3) will be turned on and the ENDF/B-VI.6 neutron libraries are
used. All protons are transported using LAHET physics. Nucleon and pion
interactions simulated by LAHET physics use the Bertini intranuclear
cascade model. Variations from this base case are outlined in Table
10.3. For each case 20,000 source protons were transported. Note that in
MCNPX, Bertini INC was the default physics option. In MCNP6, however,
the default option is CEM03.03; therefore, we need to specify the
following LCA card to activate Bertini INC: lca 8j 0 . In this example
we refer to Bertini INC as the 'base case.'

For the sake of brevity, we reproduce here just the neutron problem
summaries from the MCNP6 output decks.

The two methods for calculating total neutron production give the
following results:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Both methods give the same answer. Since 'escapes + captures' is easier
to calculate, this is the method typically used. A reasonable upper
limit on the relative uncertainty of n/p is √ 20000 ≈ 0 . 7% .

## 10.5.1.2 Case 1

In the first variation we transport not only nucleons (denoted by the
symbols n and h on the MODE card) and charged pions ( / ), but also
light ions (deuterons, tritons, 3 He, and alphas, denoted by d , t , s ,
and a , respectively). Thus, the only differences are on the MODE and
IMP cards, with the changed cards shown in Listing 10.39.

```
mode n h / d t s a
```

```
imp:n,h,/,d,t,s,a 1 1 0
```

Note that nuclear interactions by light ions are simulated using the
ISABEL INC model. The problem summary for this case is shown in Listing
10.40.

Net neutron production for this case is 17.398 n/p, or 0.17% above the
base case value. Examination of the net nuclear interactions and net (n,
x n) figures show very similar results to the base case. The implication
of this result is that we need not concern ourselves with light ion
transport if the quantity with which we are concerned is related solely
to neutrons, as neutron production by light ions is small when we start
with a proton beam.

## 10.5.1.3 Case 2

In the second variation we replace the Bertini INC model used in the
base case for the simulation of nucleon and pion interactions with
nuclei by the ISABEL INC model (in this example, both INC models utilize
the same GCCI level-density model). We invoke the ISABEL INC model by
changing the LCA card and adding the LCB card as shown in Listing 10.41.

Listing 10.41: Excerpt from example\_isabel\_inc\_1.mcnp.inp.txt

| lca   | 2j 2 5j 0    |
|-------|--------------|
| lcb   | 4j 1000 1000 |

This changes the value of the variable iexisa (3rd value on the LCA
card) from its default value of 1 to 2, and increases the flenb5 and
flenb6 parameters controlling the ISABEL INC transition energies to the
proton source energy of 1 GeV. The neutron problem summary for this case
is shown in Listing 10.42.

In the MCNP6 summary table, information is provided about the event-
generator models used in the calculation. This information assists users
to better understand the results and how they were calculated. For this
particular case, we specified lca 2J 2 5J 0 and lcb 4J 1000 1000 to
invoke ISABEL INC for all energies 1 GeV and lower. Note the net neutron
production calculated using the ISABEL INC model is 16.371 n/p, which is
5.75% below the predicted base case value using the Bertini INC model.
This result is consistent with other studies that reveal slightly lower
neutron production resulting from ISABEL as compared to Bertini.

## 10.5.1.4 Case 3

In this variation, we use the CEM03.03 model for neutrons, protons, and
pions. CEM is turned on by setting the 9th entry of the LCA card, icem =
1 , as shown in Listing 10.43.

Listing 10.43: Excerpt from example\_cem\_physics\_1.mcnp.inp.txt

lca 8j 1

Because CEM03.03 is the default physics option in MCNP6, no LCA card is
required to invoke CEM03.03 physics. Unlike the other INC models in the
code, CEM03.03 includes its own Modified Preequilibrium Model (MEM)
[200, 204] and its own extension (see details in [216]) of the
Generalized Evaporation Model (GEM) by Furihata [259]. Therefore, the
Multistage Pre-equilibrium Model (MPM) by Prael and Bozoian [256] and
evaporation model settings used for the Bertini INC and ISABEL models
have no effect when CEM03.03 is specified.

The neutron summary table for this case is shown in Listing 10.44.

Note the net neutron production calculated with the CEM03.03 model is
18.33 n/p, which is 5.53% above the value predicted by the Bertini INC
model.

## 10.5.1.5 Case 4

In the final variation from the base case we use the INCL model coupled
with the ABLA evaporation mode by changing the LCA card as shown in
Listing 10.45.

Note: The ABLA evaporation model is automatically chosen when INCL is
specified.

The neutron problem summary for this case is shown in Listing 10.46.
