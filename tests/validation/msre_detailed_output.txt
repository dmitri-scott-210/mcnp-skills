  warning.  no final keff estimate made because no active cycles run.

 the initial fission neutron source distribution used the   9 source points that were input on the ksrc card.
 the criticality problem was scheduled to skip  50 cycles and run a total of  500 cycles with nominally    10000 neutrons per cycle.
 this problem has run   0 inactive cycles with     2245 neutron histories and    0 active cycles with           0 neutron histories.


 this calculation did not finish because only    0 of the requested  500 keff cycles were completed.

  warning.          1 fission cell elements had no neutron collisions
 
  warning.          1 fission cell elements had no fission source points

 the keff results could be too small because cells with fissionable material were not sampled.
 see print table 128 for unsampled repeated structures or finite lattice elements.
 cannot guarantee sampling of all elements in infinite lattice cell      100.
