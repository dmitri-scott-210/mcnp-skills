VOID TEST EXAMPLE

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-geometry-checker skill
COMPLEXITY: Basic
DEMONSTRATES: VOID card usage for overlap detection

KEY FEATURES:
- VOID card in Data Cards block
- Simple 2-region geometry (water + steel)
- NPS 1000 for quick test
- Check output for "void = 0.00000E+00"

INTERPRETATION:
- VOID = 0 → No overlaps (geometry correct)
- VOID ≠ 0 → Overlaps exist (must fix)

USAGE:
Run MCNP and search output for "void" keyword.
Result should be 0.00000E+00 for valid geometry.
