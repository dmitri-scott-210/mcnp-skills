EXAMPLE 03: Importance Card Count Mismatch

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-cross-reference-checker skill
COMPLEXITY: Intermediate

DEMONSTRATES:
- Importance card entry count must match cell count exactly
- FATAL error when IMP entries > cell count
- WARNING when IMP entries < cell count
- Fix: Correct IMP card to have exactly 7 entries

ERROR MESSAGE (from MCNP):
"too many entries on imp:n card. 7 cells. 9 entries."

KEY FEATURES:
- 7 cells defined in Cell Cards block
- IMP:N has 9 entries (too many by 2)
- MCNP terminates with FATAL error
- Common error after adding/deleting cells

COUNT VALIDATION:
Cells defined: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 = 7 total
IMP:N entries: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 = 9 entries
Mismatch: 9 > 7 → FATAL ERROR

DIAGNOSIS STEPS:
1. Count cells in Cell Cards block: 7 cells
2. Parse IMP:N card entries (split by spaces): 9 values
3. Compare: 9 ≠ 7 → MISMATCH
4. Error type: Too many (FATAL)

FIX:
Remove 2 extra entries from IMP:N:
IMP:N 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  ← Exactly 7 entries now

IMPORTANT RULES:
- IMP entries = cell count (EXACT match required)
- Too many entries → FATAL (MCNP terminates)
- Too few entries → WARNING (MCNP assumes 0 for missing, may kill particles)
- Update IMP card whenever adding/deleting cells

USAGE NOTES:
This error commonly occurs when:
1. Cells added/deleted but IMP not updated
2. Copying IMP from different input with different cell count
3. Using importance in cell cards and IMP card (double specification)

Always count cells before writing IMP card!
