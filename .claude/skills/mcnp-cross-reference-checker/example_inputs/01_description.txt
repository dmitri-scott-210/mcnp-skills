EXAMPLE 01: Undefined Surface Reference

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-cross-reference-checker skill
COMPLEXITY: Basic

DEMONSTRATES:
- Cell → Surface cross-reference validation
- FATAL error when cell references undefined surface
- How to identify missing surface definitions
- Fix: Add surface 203 definition

ERROR MESSAGE (from MCNP):
"fatal error. surface 203 in cell 10 is not defined."

KEY FEATURES:
- Cell 10 geometry uses surface 203: "-1 2 -203 4"
- Surface 203 is NOT defined in Surface Cards block
- MCNP terminates with FATAL error before running

CROSS-REFERENCE ANALYSIS:
Cell 1 → Surfaces [1, 2, 3] ✓
Cell 10 → Surfaces [1, 2, 203, 4] ✗ (Surface 203 missing!)
Cell 15 → Surface [1] ✓

DIAGNOSIS STEPS:
1. Parse cell 10 geometry expression: "-1 2 -203 4"
2. Extract surface numbers: 1, 2, 203, 4
3. Check Surface Cards block for each surface
4. Find surface 203 is NOT defined → FATAL

FIX OPTIONS:
A. Add surface 203 definition (01_undefined_surface_fixed.i shows this)
   203 PZ 20.5
B. Correct cell geometry if 203 was a typo
   - Maybe meant surface 3 instead of 203?
C. Remove reference if not needed

RELATED SKILLS:
- mcnp-input-validator: Detects this error during pre-run validation
- mcnp-geometry-builder: Create correct surface definitions from start

USAGE NOTES:
This is the most common cross-reference error in MCNP. Always verify all referenced surfaces exist before running.
