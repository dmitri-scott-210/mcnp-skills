EXAMPLE: 90° Rotation About Z-Axis

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-transform-editor skill
COMPLEXITY: Basic

DEMONSTRATES:
- Rotation-only TR card (12 parameters: translation + matrix)
- 90° counterclockwise rotation about z-axis
- Reorienting a cylindrical component

KEY FEATURES:
- Cylinder originally along +x axis (0 to 10 cm in x)
- Rotated 90° CCW about z-axis → cylinder along +y axis
- Translation is zero (rotation about origin)
- Matrix form shown explicitly

TR CARD:
*TR1  0 0 0  0 -1 0  1 0 0  0 0 1    $ 90° CCW about z-axis

ROTATION MATRIX INTERPRETATION:
Row 1: (0, -1, 0)  → new x-axis points along old -y direction
Row 2: (1,  0, 0)  → new y-axis points along old +x direction
Row 3: (0,  0, 1)  → new z-axis unchanged

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Original cylinder: axis from (0,0,0) to (10,0,0)
- Rotated cylinder: axis from (0,0,0) to (0,10,0)
- Both cylinders R=2 cm

USAGE NOTES:
- Rotation matrices must be orthonormal (validate before use)
- Right-hand rule: positive rotation is CCW looking down axis toward origin
- Can use degree input instead: *TR1  0 0 0  0 0 90  1
