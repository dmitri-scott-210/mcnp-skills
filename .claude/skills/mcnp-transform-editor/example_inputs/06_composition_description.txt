EXAMPLE: Transformation Composition

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-transform-editor skill
COMPLEXITY: Advanced

DEMONSTRATES:
- Composing two transformations into one
- Mathematical: TR3 = TR2 ∘ TR1 (TR1 first, then TR2)
- Verification that composition works correctly

KEY FEATURES:
- TR1: Rotate cylinder 90° about z (vertical → horizontal along +y)
- TR2: Translate by (10, 0, 0)
- TR3: Composition (rotate, then translate)
- Three cylinders shown for comparison

TR CARDS:
*TR1  0 0 0  0 -1 0  1 0 0  0 0 1     $ Rotate 90° CCW about z
*TR2  10 0 0                          $ Translate +10 in x
*TR3  10 0 0  0 -1 0  1 0 0  0 0 1    $ Composition of TR1 and TR2

COMPOSITION CALCULATION:
R3 = R2 · R1 = I · R1 = R1
d3 = d2 + R2·d1 = (10,0,0) + I·(0,0,0) = (10,0,0)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Cylinder 1: Original (vertical, at origin)
- Cylinder 2: TR3 applied → horizontal along +y, center at (10,0,0)
- All three should produce same final geometry for cylinder 2

VERIFICATION:
- Apply TR1 then TR2 manually = apply TR3 directly
- Use scripts/tr_composition.py to calculate TR3

USAGE NOTES:
- Composition order matters: TR2∘TR1 ≠ TR1∘TR2 (generally)
- Matrix multiplication: R3 = R2·R1 (right-to-left reading)
- Translation: d3 = d2 + R2·d1 (rotation affects translation)
- Use composition for complex multi-step transformations
