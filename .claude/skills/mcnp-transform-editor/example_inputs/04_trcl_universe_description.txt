EXAMPLE: TRCL Usage with Universes

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-transform-editor skill
COMPLEXITY: Intermediate

DEMONSTRATES:
- Cell transformation using TRCL parameter
- Placing a universe with transformation
- Difference between surface TR and cell TRCL

KEY FEATURES:
- Detector defined in universe 1 at origin
- Cell 10 fills with universe 1, applies TRCL=1
- TRCL transforms the filled universe's orientation and position
- Multiple cells can fill same universe with different TRCLs

TR CARDS:
*TR1  10 10 0     $ First placement
*TR2  -10 10 0    $ Second placement
*TR3  10 -10 0    $ Third placement
*TR4  -10 -10 0   $ Fourth placement

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Four identical detectors from universe 1
- Placed at four corners: (±10, ±10, 0)
- Each detector R=3 cm sphere

COMPARISON:
Surface TR:
  - Transforms the surface definition
  - 10 1 SO 5.0  $ Surface 10 uses TR1

Cell TRCL:
  - Transforms the universe filling the cell
  - 10  0  -100  FILL=1  TRCL=1  $ Cell fills with universe 1, transformed

RELATED SKILLS:
- mcnp-lattice-builder: Regular vs irregular component placement
- mcnp-geometry-builder: Universe concept

USAGE NOTES:
- TRCL is used with FILL parameter to place universes
- Each cell can have different TRCL for same universe
- Don't apply both surface TR and cell TRCL to same geometry (double transformation)
