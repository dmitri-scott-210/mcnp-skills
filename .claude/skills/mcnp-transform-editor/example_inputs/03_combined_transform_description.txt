EXAMPLE: Combined Translation and Rotation

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-transform-editor skill
COMPLEXITY: Intermediate

DEMONSTRATES:
- Translation + rotation in single TR card
- Order of operations: rotation first, then translation
- Placing a fuel pin at specific position with specific orientation

KEY FEATURES:
- Fuel pin originally vertical (axis along +z)
- Rotated 90° about y-axis → horizontal (axis along +x)
- Then translated to (20, 15, 0)
- Final result: horizontal pin at offset position

TR CARD:
*TR1  20 15 0  0 0 1  0 1 0  -1 0 0    $ Rotate 90° about y, then translate

TRANSFORMATION BREAKDOWN:
1. Rotation: 90° about y-axis
   - Vertical pin (0,0,0)→(0,0,10) becomes horizontal (0,0,0)→(10,0,0)
2. Translation: Move to (20, 15, 0)
   - Horizontal pin now at (20,15,0)→(30,15,0)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Original pin: vertical at origin, (0,0,0) to (0,0,10)
- Transformed pin: horizontal at (20,15,0) to (30,15,0)
- Both pins R=0.5 cm, H=10 cm

USAGE NOTES:
- MCNP applies rotation BEFORE translation (mathematical convention)
- To rotate about a point other than origin, compose transformations
- Use scripts/tr_composition.py for complex transformation sequences
