EXAMPLE: Reflection for Symmetric Geometry

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-transform-editor skill
COMPLEXITY: Intermediate

DEMONSTRATES:
- Reflection transformation (improper rotation)
- Creating symmetric components via mirroring
- Determinant = -1 for reflections

KEY FEATURES:
- Original component in +X half-space
- Reflected component in -X half-space (mirror across YZ plane)
- Reflection matrix has determinant = -1

TR CARD:
*TR1  0 0 0  -1 0 0  0 1 0  0 0 1    $ Reflect across YZ plane (x → -x)

REFLECTION MATRIX:
Row 1: (-1, 0, 0)  → x-coordinate flipped
Row 2: ( 0, 1, 0)  → y-coordinate unchanged
Row 3: ( 0, 0, 1)  → z-coordinate unchanged
Determinant = -1 (improper rotation/reflection)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Original box: center at (5, 0, 0)
- Reflected box: center at (-5, 0, 0)
- Perfect mirror symmetry across YZ plane

OTHER COMMON REFLECTIONS:
- Reflect across XZ (y → -y): R = [1 0 0; 0 -1 0; 0 0 1]
- Reflect across XY (z → -z): R = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 -1]

USAGE NOTES:
- MCNP accepts reflections (determinant = -1)
- Verify particle transport behaves correctly with reflections
- Reflections reverse chirality (left-hand ↔ right-hand)
- Useful for creating symmetric geometry efficiently
