EXAMPLE: Simple Translation of Detector

SOURCE: Created for mcnp-transform-editor skill
COMPLEXITY: Basic

DEMONSTRATES:
- Translation-only TR card (3 parameters)
- Moving a component from origin to specific position
- Using surface transformation (TR number in surface card)

KEY FEATURES:
- Detector sphere at origin (surface 1)
- Same detector translated to (15, 0, 0) using TR1 (surface 2)
- Demonstrates that translation vector points to new location
- No rotation applied (translation only)

TR CARD:
*TR1  15 0 0    $ Move +15 cm in x-direction

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Two identical spheres (R=5 cm)
- One at origin (0, 0, 0)
- One at (15, 0, 0)

- mcnp-input-validator: Validating TR card syntax

USAGE NOTES:
- Translation-only transformations use just 3 parameters
- Positive values move in positive axis direction
- Multiple surfaces can use the same TR number
