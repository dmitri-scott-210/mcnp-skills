c NOTES AND USAGE
c ========================================================================
c
c 1. Concrete Types Comparison:
c    - Ordinary: 2.3 g/cm3, most economical, general purpose
c    - Barite: 3.5 g/cm3, better gamma shield, more expensive
c    - Magnetite: 3.7 g/cm3, best performance, heavy/expensive
c
c 2. Gamma vs. Neutron Shielding:
c    - Gamma: Use high-Z materials (lead, barite concrete)
c    - Neutron: Use hydrogen-rich (polyethylene, ordinary concrete)
c    - Combined: Layered approach or heavy concrete
c
c 3. Lead Considerations:
c    - Excellent gamma attenuator (high Z=82)
c    - Poor neutron shield (induces (n,γ) reactions)
c    - Combine with hydrogenous material for mixed fields
c
c 4. Polyethylene S(alpha,beta):
c    - POLY.40t for thermal scattering (293.6 K)
c    - Critical for accurate neutron thermalization
c
c 5. Borated Polyethylene:
c    - 5% boron shown is typical commercial
c    - Available: 1%, 5%, 10%, 30% boron loading
c    - Higher loading = better absorption, higher density
c    - Natural boron: 19.9% B-10, 80.1% B-11
c
c 6. Concrete Composition Variability:
c    - Compositions shown are typical, vary by region
c    - Aggregate type determines properties
c    - Water content affects hydrogen (shown is dried)
c
c 7. Material Combinations:
c    - Lead + polyethylene: Good gamma + neutron
c    - Concrete: Reasonable for both, economical
c    - Steel + polyethylene: Structural + neutron
c
c 8. Temperature Effects:
c    - All shown at room temperature
c    - Elevated temps: Update TMP cards if >400 K
c    - Concrete loses water at high temps (affects neutron shield)
