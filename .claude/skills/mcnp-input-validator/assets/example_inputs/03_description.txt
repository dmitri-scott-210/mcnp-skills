EXAMPLE 03: Importance Card Entry Count Mismatch

ERROR TYPE: F-006 (FATAL - Importance)
COMPLEXITY: Basic

DEMONSTRATES:
- IMP card must have EXACTLY one entry per cell
- Count mismatch causes fatal error
- How to identify and fix mismatch

INVALID FILE (03_imp_count_mismatch_INVALID.i):
- 3 cells defined (cells 1, 2, 3)
- IMP:N has only 2 entries: "1 1"
- Missing importance for cell 3
- MCNP fatal error: "importance card entry count wrong"

FIXED FILE (03_imp_count_mismatch_FIXED.i):
- IMP:N has 3 entries: "1 1 0"
- Matches 3 cells defined
- Cell 3 (outside world) has IMP=0 (particle escape)
- Cells 1-2 have IMP=1 (particles transported)

KEY LESSON:
IMP card entries must match cell count EXACTLY.

Count cells in input:
  Cell 1: IMP entry 1
  Cell 2: IMP entry 2
  Cell 3: IMP entry 3

IMP:N  [entry1] [entry2] [entry3]

For graveyard/outside cells: Use IMP=0
For active regions: Use IMP=1 (or higher for variance reduction)

SHORTCUT:
Use R (repeat) for many cells with same importance:
  IMP:N  1 10R 0
  Means: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 (12 entries)

HOW TO FIX:
1. Count cells in Cell Cards block
2. Count IMP card entries
3. If mismatch:
   - Add missing entries, OR
   - Remove extra entries
4. Graveyard cell should have IMP=0

VALIDATION CHECK:
Validator detects:
  "FATAL: IMP:N card has 2 entries but 3 cells exist"
  "Missing importance for cell 3"
  "Fix: Add 3rd entry to IMP:N card (suggest value 0 if outside world)"
