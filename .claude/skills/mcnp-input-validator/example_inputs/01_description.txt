EXAMPLE 01: Missing Blank Line Between Blocks

ERROR TYPE: F-001 (FATAL - Block Structure)
COMPLEXITY: Basic

DEMONSTRATES:
- Most common MCNP format error
- Missing blank line separators between blocks
- How MCNP requires EXACTLY 2 blank lines total

INVALID FILE (01_missing_blank_line_INVALID.i):
- Missing blank line after Cell Cards block
- Missing blank line after Surface Cards block
- MCNP will fail to parse correctly
- Fatal error on execution

FIXED FILE (01_missing_blank_line_FIXED.i):
- Blank line added after line "2    0          1"
- Blank line added after line "1    SO    10"
- Exactly 2 blank lines total in file
- File will parse correctly

KEY LESSON:
MCNP requires EXACTLY 2 blank lines:
  1. After Cell Cards block
  2. After Surface Cards block

NO blank lines within any block.

Use comment headers (c ===) for visual separation, NOT blank lines.
