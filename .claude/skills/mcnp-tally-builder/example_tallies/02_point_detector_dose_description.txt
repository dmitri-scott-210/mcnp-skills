Example 2: Point Detector Dose (F5 with DE/DF)

PURPOSE:
Calculate dose rate at a detector location using F5 point detector with flux-to-dose conversion factors.

GEOMETRY:
- Void geometry (no scattering, direct line-of-sight calculation)
- Fission spectrum source at origin
- Detector at 100 cm distance

TALLY DETAILS:
- F5:N = Point detector next-event estimator
- Format: F5:N  x y z R (detector at x,y,z with exclusion radius R)
- R=0.5 cm exclusion radius (particles within 0.5 cm of detector are excluded)
- DE5/DF5 = Dose conversion factors (ANSI/ANS-6.1.1-1977 standard)
- DE5 = Energy grid for interpolation
- DF5 = Flux-to-dose factors in rem/h per (neutron/cm²/s)

KEY LEARNING POINTS:
1. F5 gives flux at a POINT (not volume-averaged like F4)
2. Next-event estimator = high efficiency for localized detectors
3. Exclusion radius R prevents statistical issues for nearby particles
4. DE/DF converts flux to dose equivalent using standard factors
5. Result is dose rate (rem/h per source particle)

DOSE CONVERSION:
- DE5 energies must cover source spectrum range
- DF5 values from ICRP-74, ICRP-116, or ANSI/ANS-6.1.1-1977
- Interpolation: logarithmic (default) between energy points
- Units: rem/h or Sv/h (depends on DF values used)

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Dose rate at detector (rem/h per source particle)
- To get absolute dose rate: multiply by source strength (particles/s)
- Typical result: ~1E-8 rem/h per neutron/s for this geometry

VARIATIONS TO TRY:
- Add shielding (concrete wall between source and detector)
- Multiple detectors (F15, F25, F35 at different locations)
- Change to ICRP-60 factors: DF5 IC=99 IU=1 FAC=-3
- Vary detector distance (50 cm, 200 cm, 500 cm)
- Add energy bins to E5 card for dose spectrum
