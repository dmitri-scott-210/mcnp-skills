Example 3: Reaction Rates (F4 + FM)

PURPOSE:
Calculate neutron-induced reaction rates in U-235 fuel using FM card multipliers.

GEOMETRY:
- Small U-235 metal sphere (2 cm radius, 19.1 g/cm³)
- Surrounded by void (no moderation)
- 2 MeV point source at center

TALLY DETAILS:
- F4:N = Cell flux tally
- FM4 = Reaction rate multiplier card creating 4 separate bins
- FM format: (c m R) where:
  - c = normalization constant (-1 = multiply by atom density for macroscopic rate)
  - m = material number
  - R = reaction number (MT or special R number)
- Bins:
  1. R = -6: Total fission cross section
  2. R = -2: Absorption cross section
  3. R = 16: (n,2n) reaction (MT=16)
  4. R = 102: (n,γ) radiative capture (MT=102)

KEY LEARNING POINTS:
1. FM card converts flux to reaction rate (reactions/cm³)
2. c = -1 multiplies by atom density → macroscopic rates
3. Special R numbers (negative): -6 (fission), -2 (absorption), etc.
4. MT numbers (positive): 16 (n,2n), 102 (n,γ), 103 (n,p), etc.
5. Multiple bins in one FM card create separate tally outputs

REACTION NUMBERS:
- R = -1: Total cross section
- R = -2: Absorption
- R = -6: Total fission
- R = 16: (n,2n)
- R = 102: (n,γ)
- See references/fm_reaction_numbers_complete.md for full table

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Four separate tally bins showing reaction rates (reactions/cm³) vs energy
- Fission rate highest at thermal energies
- (n,2n) threshold around 6 MeV for U-235
- Can compare relative importance of different reactions

VARIATIONS TO TRY:
- Add fission neutron production: FM4 (-1 1 -6 -7) for ν*σ_f
- Try different materials (Pu-239, Th-232, natural uranium)
- Add more reactions: MT=18 (fission), MT=103 (n,p), MT=107 (n,α)
- Calculate criticality importance: FM4 (1 1 -2) (1 -2) for neutron lifetime
