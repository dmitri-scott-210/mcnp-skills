 there is not enough information in the largest  history scores (usually less than 500 scores) for a reliable estimate of the slope.
 the history score probability density function appears to have an unsampled region at the largest  history scores:

 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 warning.       8 of the    12 tally fluctuation chart bins did not pass all 10 statistical checks.
 warning.       1 of the    12 tallies were all zeros.
 warning.       4 of the    12 tallies had bins with relative errors greater than recommended.
