c       see pp 57 of UCRL-51144, Rev I.

c       ------------------
c       Note:  While these 13 "atom fractions" only sum to 0.9966908 (not 1.000000),
c       they were taken from page 142 of LA-12885 (Dec 1994).  Moreover, the atom
c       fractions for the first 8 entries (O, H, Si, Ca, Al, C, Mg, and Na) are also
c       the same as given on pp 309 & 315 of UCRL-51144, Rev I (Feb 1972), which goes
c       on to simply note that the trace elements Fe, K (missing here), Ti, and Mn
c       each account for less than 1.0 at% (each).  While one could speculate that
c       potassium (K=19000) might account for the missing 0.33092 at% (at frac=
c       0.0033092), or that the LANL numbers for the trace elements (last 5 entries)
c       should be renormalized to sum to 1.3 at% (at frac=0.013), such small changes
c       would be well below the uncertainties in most composition specs. In the absence
c       of any clear knowledge on this negligible quantity, we have chosen to simply
c       keep the same traditional material specs previously used by LANL in LA-12885.
c       In this case, mcnp will automatically adjust all fractions to sum to 1.0 exactly.
