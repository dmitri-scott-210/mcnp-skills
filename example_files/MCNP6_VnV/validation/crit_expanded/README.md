# MCNP6 Expanded Criticality Validation

The MCNP Criticality Validation Suite is a collection of models of 119 benchmarks taken from the International Handbook of Evaluation Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments.  Calculated Keff from MCNP6 can then be compared to experimental values.  These benchmarks contain simulations of systems with fast, intermediate, and thermal spectrums, light, heavy or no reflectors, lattices of fuel pins and liquid solutions.  This expanded set is designed to be more rigorous than the basic criticality suite.

This directory contains the *experiments* subdirectory, the *references* subdirectory, this *README.md*, and a few supporting python scripts to be used to run, process and analyze results.  Instructions on the use of these python scripts will be updated in due time.
