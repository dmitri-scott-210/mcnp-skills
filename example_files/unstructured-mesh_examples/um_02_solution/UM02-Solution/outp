 this tally meets the statistical criteria used to form confidence intervals: check the tally fluctuation chart to verify.
 the results in other bins associated with this tally may not meet these statistical criteria.

 the estimated slope of the 133 largest  tallies starting at  3.11240E+00 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the large score tail of the empirical history score probability density function appears to have no unsampled regions.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 the estimated slope of the 198 largest  tallies starting at  4.12832E+00 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the history score probability density function appears to have an unsampled region at the largest  history scores:

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 the estimated slope of the 200 largest  tallies starting at  4.39014E+00 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the history score probability density function appears to have an unsampled region at the largest  history scores:

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   missed  1 of 10 tfc bin checks: the estimated mean has a trend during the last half of the problem                        
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 warning.       1 of the     1 tally fluctuation chart bins did not pass all 10 statistical checks.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 the estimated slope of the 200 largest  tallies starting at  4.85993E+00 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the large score tail of the empirical history score probability density function appears to have no unsampled regions.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 this tally meets the statistical criteria used to form confidence intervals: check the tally fluctuation chart to verify.
 the results in other bins associated with this tally may not meet these statistical criteria.

 the estimated slope of the 198 largest  tallies starting at  5.11389E+00 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the large score tail of the empirical history score probability density function appears to have no unsampled regions.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        4   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.
