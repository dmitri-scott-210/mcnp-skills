## METHODOLOGY

**Approach Used:**
1. Read both CLAUDE-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md and user's corrected GLOBAL-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md
2. Created comprehensive comparison analysis (comparison-analysis.md)
3. Identified all missing sections with line number references
4. Systematically integrated missing content section by section
5. Expanded truncated sections to match original detail level
6. Added completely missing sections in logical order
7. Preserved ALL user's parallel execution additions
8. Verified final line count and content completeness

**User's Instruction Followed:**
"You need to integrate what's missing from CLAUDE-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md into GLOBAL-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md. Don't rewrite the entire file. I already merged the PR and closed it, plus I made my own edits to mcnp-skills/GLOBAL-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md to mitigate your massive fuck up. So you need to start from there and COMPREHENSIVELY and ASSIDUOUSLY update GLOBAL-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md based on your detailed comparison review of what's missing from CLAUDE-SESSION-REQUIREMENTS.md. Fuck token optimization, you need to do this correctly."

**Result:** ✅ COMPREHENSIVELY and ASSIDUOUSLY integrated all missing content without rewriting user's corrections
