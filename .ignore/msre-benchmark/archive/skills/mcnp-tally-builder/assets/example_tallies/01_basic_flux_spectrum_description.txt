Example 1: Basic Flux Spectrum (F4 with Energy Bins)

PURPOSE:
Demonstrate F4 track-length flux tally with energy binning to calculate neutron energy spectrum in a water sphere.

GEOMETRY:
- Simple spherical water volume (10 cm radius)
- Point isotropic source at center (14.1 MeV neutrons)

TALLY DETAILS:
- F4:N = Track-length estimator of cell flux
- E4 card = 10 energy bins spanning thermal (1E-10 MeV) to fast (15 MeV)
- SD4 card = Volume specification for flux normalization (particles/cm²)

KEY LEARNING POINTS:
1. F4 tallies volume-averaged flux (requires volume specification)
2. E4 card creates energy spectrum (10 bins from thermal to fast)
3. SD4 overrides MCNP-calculated volume (useful for irregular cells)
4. Energy bins should span expected spectrum range
5. Results show how 14.1 MeV neutrons thermalize in water

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Flux vs energy showing:
  - Peak at 14.1 MeV (source energy, uncollided)
  - Slowing-down distribution from 14 → 1 MeV
  - Thermal peak at ~0.025 eV (thermalized neutrons)

VARIATIONS TO TRY:
- Change source energy (1 MeV, 2.5 MeV, fission spectrum)
- Vary water sphere radius (5 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm)
- Add energy bins (use LOG or ILOG shortcuts)
- Try different materials (iron, concrete, lead)
